//! Substrate routing types for multi-substrate cognitive processing.
//!
//! The cognitive architecture has four computational substrates, each answering
//! a different question about the same concept:
//!
//! - **Structural**: Binary Hamming — "Have I seen this exact pattern before?"
//! - **Soaking**: BCM organic registers — "Is this concept still forming or settled?"
//! - **Evidential**: NARS truth values — "How much should I trust this?"
//! - **Semantic**: f32 embeddings — "What else is this like?"
//!
//! This module provides the TYPES for substrate routing. The actual
//! ThinkingStyle → SubstrateRoute mapping lives upstream (crewai-rust)
//! because rustynum never imports style types. rustynum is Level 1 (Surface).
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ```text
